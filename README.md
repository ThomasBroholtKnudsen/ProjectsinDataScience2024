# ProjectsinDataScience2024

Repository for the final assignment in course BSPRDAS1KU (spring 2024)

# Dependencies
These packages must be installed to run the scripts:\
pip install numpy\
pip install matplotlib\
pip install scikit-image\
pip install pandas\
pip install scikit-learn

# How to use the scripts
## Step 1: Changes in 01_process_images.py
Line 33: Provide a path for the metadata file.\
Line 34: Provide a path for the folder where the raw images are stored.\
Line 35: Provide a path for the folder where the binary masks are stored.\
Line 38: The path for the file where the feature scores will be stored is set to features\features.csv.\
Line 44: Provide the column name containing the image IDs from the metadata-file.\
Line 63: Change the filename for the binary masks. It is assummed that the filenames for the masks consist of the image_id plus a string, to tell that it is a mask. E.g. "PAT_31_42_680_mask.png", where the filename is image_id + "_mask" + file type.

## Step 2: Changes in 02_train_classifier.py
Line 27: The metadata file created from our subset of the PAD-UFES-20 currently set to "data\okapi_data_metadata.csv".\
Line 31: Provide column name containing the image IDs from the metadata-file.\
Line 43: The path for the file where the feature scores will be stored is set to "features\features.csv".\
Line 128: Provide a path for where the classifier file should be stored, currently sset to "groupOkapi_classifier.sav".

## Step 3: Changes in 03_evaluate_classifier.py
Line 28: Provide a path for the image, otherwise you will be prompted to do so in the Terminal.\
Line 30: Provide a path for the mask, otherwise you will be prompted to do so in the Terminal.

## For the Krippendorff's Alpha kripp_alpha_with_computer_scores.R
If wanting to run again, ensure the following:\
Line 5: csv_file_kripp_alpha.csv is in the same location as this script.\
Line 9: features.csv, the output of the generated feature scores is in the same location as this script, or change the file path.

## Contents of Repository
okapi_annotation_scores.xlsx: our manual annotation scores, retained for reference and to calculate Krippendorff Alpha.\
archive folder: useful parts of the history of our project.\
okapi_data_metadata.csv: This is where we drew our metadata from, it is a subset of the original PAD-UFES-20 dataset.\
data: This folder contains the subset of images and masks we worked with (Okapi_raw_images, groupOkapi_masks), the image and mask we evaluated using our classifier (nora_external_test_data), and two csv files of metadata, one of the entire dataset (metadata.csv) and one of a filtered set of the metadata for just our images (okapi_data_metadata.csv).
